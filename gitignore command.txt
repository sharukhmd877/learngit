GITIGNORE

we created a folder which containes files -- index.txt and password (password containes confidential data which i do not want to push)
open the terminal 
git init
git status (can see the file index.txt and password)
went bcak to folder and created a new file ---> .gitignore (containes -- password)
went back to my terminal _
git status (now i can see index.txt and .gitignore)
git add .
git commit -m "_____"
created a repo in github
terminal ---> git remote add origin REPO_URL
			git push origin master 
			
can check by refreshing github repo that instead 3 file index.txt, .gitignore and password. Only two file get pushed.
